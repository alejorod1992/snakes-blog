                    <p>They are reptiles with elongated and narrow bodies that have no limbs. There are currently more
                        than 3,000 different species of snakes, which inhabit all continents except Antarctica. Snakes
                        are carnivorous and feed primarily on mice, lizards, insects, fish, frogs and even eggs to
                        survive. Although snakes are considered pests in some areas, they help control the rodent
                        population.</p>
                    <p> They're ectotherms, which means that they can’t regulate their body temperature from within, as
                        humans do. Instead, they use their environment, basking in the sun to keep warm or slipping
                        underground to cool off./p>

                    <p> Snakes prefer to avoid people, and will generally only bite when they are picked up, stepped
                        on,
                        or otherwise provoked. Though most of our snakes are harmless, several species have defensive
                        displays, like exuding a smelly musk or rattling their tails. These harmless behaviors often
                        cause frightened people to kill the snake
                    </p>
                    <p>Snakes breed during the warmer months; most of our species mate in the late spring, and have
                        young in the summer. Some species, like the eastern milk snake, lay eggs. Others, like the
                        timber rattlesnake, give birth to live young.
                        In the fall, snakes seek shelter in places like rock crevices and mammal burrows. It’s not
                        uncommon for snakes of different species to den together in the winter.
                        Snakes never stop growing, and every now and then, they must shed the skin that they’ve
                        outgrown. Younger snakes, which grow more quickly, may shed a few times a year, and mature
                        snakes shed less frequently.</p>
