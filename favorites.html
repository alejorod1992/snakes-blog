            <h4 class="no-margin">Black Mamba</h4>
            <p>Black mambas are fast, nervous, lethally venomous, and when threatened, highly aggressive. They
                have been blamed for numerous human deaths, and African myths exaggerate their capabilities to
                legendary proportions. For these reasons, the black mamba is widely considered the world’s
                deadliest snake.</p>
            <p>Black mambas live in the savannas and rocky hills of southern and eastern Africa. They are
                Africa’s longest venomous snake, reaching up to 14 feet in length, although 8.2 feet is more the
                average. They are also among the fastest snakes in the world, slithering at speeds of up to 12.5
                miles per hour. They get their name not from their skin color, which tends to be olive to gray,
                but rather from the blue-black color of the inside of their mouth, which they display when
                threatened.</p>
            <p> They're shy and will almost always seek to escape when confronted. However, when
                cornered, these snakes will raise their heads, sometimes with a third of their body off the
                ground, spread their cobra-like neck-flap, open their black mouths, and hiss. If an attacker
                persists, the mamba will strike not once, but repeatedly, injecting large amounts of potent
                neuro- and cardiotoxin with each strike.</p>
            <p>Before the advent of black mamba antivenin, a bite from this fearsome serpent was almost always
                fatal, usually within about 20 minutes. Unfortunately, antivenin is still not widely available
                in the rural parts of the mamba’s range, and mamba-related deaths remain frequent.</p>

            <h4 class="no-margin">Horned Viper</h4>
            <p>Vipera ammodytes is a venomous viper species. There are three recognized subspecies of Vipera
                ammodytes. The most distinctive characteristic is a single “horn” on the snout, just above the
                rostral
                scale. Vipera ammodytes have a zigzag dorsal stripe set against a lighter background. This
                pattern is often fragmented.</p>
            <p> They eat rodents, small birds and small reptiles. In captivity they
                eat mice and small rats. Neonates can refuse food in rare occasions. I feed my neonate and
                sub-adult specimens with fuzzy mice every two weeks and my adult animals with adult mice once a
                month..</p>
            <p>A terrarium or plastic box of 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.3 meters (2.6 x 1.3 x 1 feet) is an adequate
                enclosure for an adult pair. Vipera ammodytes are mostly active during breeding season. Males
                during breeding season are territorial so if you house 1.1 you won’t have any issue but if you
                house 2.1 as a group you might face different behavior with males. They will combat for the
                female. Fights are not a problem since they don’t bite each other they just try to overpower
                their competition.</p>
            <p>It’s highly recommended for every venomous species that you keep or interested to keep to have
                the bite protocol. Each species has a dedicated bite protocol that includes general information
                regarding the species, information about their venom and signs and symptoms of envenomation if
                bitten. It also includes a detailed information about first aid (what to do and what not to do),
                specific treatment recommendations for medical personnel to provide appropriate care including
                information about the antivenom or antivenoms required for treatment. Finally it includes a list
                of people who specialize in snakebites and their contact information so they can be consulted to
                assist with the care if needed and a list of all the references used for the create the
                protocol.</p>
